# Proposal for a concrete5 Documentation Team

## Content

This document proposes the creation of a documentation team for concrete5, 
and outlines considerations and responsibilities for such a team. It could form the basis of a project plan.

## Background

This document originated from discussions between mrkdilkington and I.
It also incorporates related ideas made by others subsequently.

## Next Steps

To get any traction, this document would need to be hosted under a Portland Labs' official c5 github account (perhaps like [this](https://github.com/buttress/concrete5_codestyle_wg)).

One or more individuals should be authorised to accept pull requests against this document. These need not be Portland Labs'
employees but should be acceptable to Portland Labs.
mrkdilkington and I are arguably too close to this document, so it may be best to appoint independent individuals.

All interested c5 community members should be encouraged to submit pull requests to the document,
improving its content and increasing community-wide ownership of the initiative.

Once the document is deemed to have reached stability/consensus/stalemate,
it should form the basis of a project plan and lists of responsibilities for implementation.
